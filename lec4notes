Notes on Functions in Python 
- Function = name + parenthesis 
- Eg: type()
    - In this case, the name of the function is type
- To define a new function, use def functionname(arguments)

- Additional notes on functions:
	- To denote the lines of the functions, use tabbed lines

[notes: looks good!]
